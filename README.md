These data are related to marketing campaigns, based on telephone calls, from a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to understand, from this dataset, whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y) at the bank. The marketing campaigns were conducted via telephone calls. Often, more than one contact with the same client was required to determine whether the product (bank term deposit) would be acquired or not.
